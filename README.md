 Overview of the project:

 This project focuses on predicting loan eligibility using Machine Learning to support faster and fairer decisions in financial institutions. By analyzing applicant details such as income, credit score, and loan amount, the model predicts whether a loan should be approved or rejected, helping reduce risk, bias, and delays in loan processing.

 Dataset Details

The chosen dataset comes from Kaggle with 43,000+ loan application records. It includes applicant demographics, financial details, and loan information, with the target variable being Loan Status (1 = approved, 0 = rejected). The large size and relevant features make it well-suited for building accurate and generalizable ML models.
